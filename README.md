# Introduction
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER494: Data Science for Software Engineers (2023) created by Dallin Wallace for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

At this time, this project has not been cleared by the course staff (R. Acuna) for public release, and must be kept within a private repository.

# Heads, up graders/peer-reviewers!
Here are some things you might want to know about this project if you are looking through this!

First of all, thanks for grading/reviewing me! I appreciate it! Here, have a virtual high five:🖐️

Second, my visuals directory is slightly different that you might expect. Since I am basically scraping mutliple similar sources, I have different graphs for each genre. I put each type of chart in it's own folder to keep it organized. In the parent directory are also a couple of charts that compare graphs across genres. See the project_exploration for more information on these charts :D

*If you are generating the visuals, make sure you have the directories!*

Third, the highest directory has a genres.txt file whic is import to the program. It has the genres I am scraping. Evntually, I want to add more genres I think.

Fourth, did you know the the Quetzalcoatlus is a flying, giraffe-sized, carnivorous dinosaur? Look it up, it's insane!
