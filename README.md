# Introduction
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER494: Data Science for Software Engineers (2023) created by Dallin Wallace for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

It was cleared by course staff (R. Acuna) for public release on 12/24/2023.

# Heads, up graders/peer-reviewers!
Here are some things you might want to know about this project if you are looking through this!

First of all, thanks for grading/reviewing me! I appreciate it! Here, have a virtual high five:🖐️

Second, my visuals directory is slightly different that you might expect. Since I am basically scraping mutliple similar sources, I have different graphs for each genre. I put each type of chart in it's own folder to keep it organized. In the parent directory are also a few of charts that compare graphs across genres. See the project_exploration for more information on these charts :D

*If you are generating the visuals, make sure you have the directories!*

Third, the highest directory has a genres.txt file whic is import to the program. It has the genres I am scraping. Evntually, I want to add more genres I think.

Fourth, did you know the the Quetzalcoatlus is a flying, giraffe-sized, carnivorous dinosaur? Look it up, it's insane!

NEW: There is a predicition folder, which you might not be expecting. Data for the expirementation and predicition (I used the same output for both) ends up there.
