 # Introduction
Hello, this is the code and data I scraped for my analysis of book genres. In short, I scraped data from a variety of genres from goodreads.com, cleaned the data, then analysed it, comparing across genres. I also used linear regression (a machine learning algorithm) to determine the future disticiveness of a genre, though success in this regard was limited. Overall, I found some seriously interesting results in the data anlysis. For example, I found that the low-fantasy genre had a surprising amount of ratings and that manga were much more likely to be marked as in a series than comics. There are even more interesting findings discussed in the paper on the subject, which can be read here(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGY2CnM3kplbychCzUsvF8P6eWTNaRqr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109717741334806733829&rtpof=true&sd=true).
