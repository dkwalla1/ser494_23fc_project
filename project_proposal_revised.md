Keywords: Books, Genre, Subgenre

Description: I want to analyze data about book genres and subgenres. I am scraping data from the popular book review website, Goodreads.com. The goal is to analyze books from different genres and subgenres to be able to tell which smaller genres have a distinct and popular identity and to be able to map the origin of genres over time. Due to the vast number of book genres, this study will mostly focus on fictional genres, though some non-fictional ones will be used to do some basic comparisons. 

Research Questions: 
RO1: To describe the popularity/distinctness of book genres, especially smaller genres.
RO2: To describe some characteristics of various genres, such as whether books are commonly in series or not, average publication date, etc.
RO3: To describe, as much as possible with the given data, the growth of book genres over time.*

*Note: This may be impossible or problematic with current data, as I noticed Goodreads has a considerable bias toward newer books.

Intellectual Merit: This knowledge can be used by thebook publishing industry professionals market and produce books. Knowing which genres are popular, distinct, and/or trending will give these professionals information they can use to determine which genre to put a book into. For example, a cover artist can use this knowledge to make a book cover that fits into the more popular genre when a book contains elements of more than one. An author can choose to write their next book in an up and coming genre to hopefully produce better book sales. Book stores and libraries can use this information to better categorize books into helpful sections and subsections. 

Data Sourcing: The Goodreads.com website. Specifically their shelves, which can act like crowd-sourced genre identifiers for books. See the following link for the 'fiction' genre shelf: https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/fiction. The information can be scraped off the cards for each book. The information that can be scraped includes: author, title, whether the book is in a series, number of times the particular book has been shelved in that particular shelf, rating information, and publication date.

Background Knowledge: 
I will use an article such as this one, to find lists of subgenres to get information for. There are several similar articles for me to pull a variety of subgenres from. (Thompson, T. (2021, February 5). 144 genres and subgenres for fiction writing. ServiceScape. https://www.servicescape.com/blog/144-genres-and-subgenres-for-fiction-writing ).

The following two articles contain important information on the importance of understanding book genres for professionals in the publication industry. (Burton, J. (2023, July 30). Why do book categories and book genres matter?. Janey Burton. https://janeyburton.com/why-do-book-categories-book-genres-matter/) and (Christa. (2018, April 2). Genre: What is it and why does it matter?. Paper and Sage. https://www.paperandsage.com/2018/articles/genre-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter/ ).
