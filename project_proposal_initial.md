Keywords: Books, Genre, Subgenre
Description: I want to analyze data about books. I found an API with openlibrary that can give me books based on subject/genre. I am currently thinking about analyzing the emergence of specific subgenres by getting a list of books from some subgenres from the site and analyzing the publication dates of the books. I might pivot to analyzing something else about books if the data isn't good enough.  
Intellectual Merit: This knowledge will help authors discover which subgenres they can consider writing and gaining traction. It will show which genres are growing.
Data Sourcing: The openlibrary API is the best data source I can find.
Background Knowledge: 1. The documentation for the openlibrary API: https://openlibrary.org/developers. 2.How to use APIs in Python by Jason Van Schooneveld on RealPython.com: https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/ 3. I will also need an article such as this one, written by Tonya Thompson on servicescape.com about subgenres. There are several similar articles for me to pull a variety of subgenres from. https://www.servicescape.com/blog/144-genres-and-subgenres-for-fiction-writing
